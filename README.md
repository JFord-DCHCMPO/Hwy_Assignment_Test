# Hwy_Assignment_Test

Draft interactive dashboard for the Triangle Regional Model's output

https://jford-dchcmpo.github.io/Hwy_Assignment_Test/


Yet again this code is written in the originally named 'index.rmd'! This code and dashboard reads in the TRMG2 model output (note: just a single model output, however this code can be edited to read multiple model runs, however file size my cause limitations), and visualizes a number of relevant and user-friendly maps and graphics. 

The rmd is built in a flex_dashboard. Given the large size of the document, knitting the html may cause your R session (on my local machine) to 'freeze' - going blank at the screen. However, the html documents are produced, and can be seen after pushing the updated documents to github (note I recommend using github desktop for ease of access).
